# Django REST API Project

This project showcases my implementation of a REST API using Django and Django REST Framework. It's designed to handle user profiles, authentication, and status updates.

## Key Features Implemented

- **User Profiles:** Creation, updating, and authentication using Django's user model.
- **Token-based Authentication:** Secure user authentication and authorization for API endpoints.
- **Status Updates:** Posting and retrieving user status updates with associated user profiles.
- **API Documentation:** Implemented a browsable API with self-documenting features for easy exploration.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Core language for backend development.
- **Django:** Framework for building web applications in Python.
- **Django REST Framework:** Powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.
- **SQLite:** Lightweight, relational database management system used for local development.

## What I Learned

This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience in building a scalable backend API from scratch. I deepened my understanding of RESTful principles, data modeling with Django ORM, and integrating authentication mechanisms. Additionally, deploying the development server to AWS broadened my skills in cloud-based application hosting.

## Next Steps

- **Testing and Validation:** Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure API reliability.
- **Deployment:** Explore deployment options beyond local and AWS environments.
- **Enhancements:** Add features like user permissions, email verification, and social authentication to extend functionality.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_project.git`
